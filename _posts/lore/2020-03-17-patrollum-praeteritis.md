*Often shortened to 'troll' by the common folk, Patrolla Praeteritis are relics of the World Before, forgotten guardians of ancient ruins. They were rare but ever-feared dangers in the underworld during the long post-calamity, pre-reclamation era; it is not known if this is what the ancients called their creations, as the name has been preserved through oral tradition and predates any known reclamation state.*


*Though they appear to be flesh and blood creatures at first glance, this is false. Their bipedal bodies are hewn out of a strange kind of living rock that conducts electricity throughout their body for some unknown end. However, the rock is rarely visible; most patrolla are covered in heavy, highly flammable fur pelts.*


*Their mouthless heads contain eight eyes in four pairs of different sensitivities, granting them binocular vision at separate ranges. Imperial mages believe from some testing that the eyes see at different colors of light than most people, allowing them to see in the dark as the dwarves and, it is rumored, the elves can do.*


*Their hands produce a harmless but disgusting ichor for reasons that remain unknown to modern people; this ichor is extremely alchemically valuable, however. Some scholars of the ancients believe there were more components to their forms in the past, but that these living elements are all that the leftover patrollums of this era have been able to maintain. The pelt of a patrollum is also highly desirable, as it is very difficult to disable a patrollum while leaving the pelt in a usable condition. An enchanted patrollum fur coat is one of the sovereign vestments of the Imperial Crown of Duvencht.*


*Patrolla are extremely dangerous, particularly in natural mineral environments, as they will passively absorb minerals through magnetic attraction to rebuild themselves. The only way to destroy a patrollum permanently is to strike the small, interior mote core that is slightly off-center of its head. However, sunlight, fire, electricity, and acid can all partially paralyze the patrollum and reduce its speed of regeneration.*

**Patrollum Praeteritis**

*Large construct, unaligned*

**Armor Class** 15 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 105 (10d10+50)

**Speed** 40 ft.


**STR** 19 (+4) \| **DEX** 11 (+0) \| **CON** 20 (+5) \| **INT** 3 (-4) \| **WIS** 10 (+0) \| **CHA** 1 (-5)

**Senses** Darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 18

**Languages** understands the languages of its creator but can't speak

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP)


**Flawless Sight.** The patrollum has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight normally.

**Sunlight Slowdown.** While in sunlight, the patrollum has disadvantage on attack rolls and has half speed.

**Regeneration.** The patrollum regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the patrollum takes electricity or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the patrollum's next turn. The patrollum dies only if it is hit by an attack that deals 10 or more bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, electricity or fire damage while the patrollum has 0 hit points.

**Pelt.** The patrollum has a special pelt that grants it its damage resistances. If the patrollum takes 10 or more points in acid or necrotic damage, however, the patrollum loses its pelt for the remainder of the encounter (and must spend a long rest to recover it.) This changes the patrollum's resistances and vulnerabilities.

**Cognitive Overload.** If the patrollum takes 10 or more points in electricity damage from a single attack, it becomes confused for one round. It must roll a d10 before its next turn to decide its behavior for that turn.


*On a 1*: The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.

*On 2-6*: The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.

*On 7-8*: The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.

*On 9-10*: The creature can act and move normally.


**Multiattack.** The patrollum makes two slam attacks a round.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
